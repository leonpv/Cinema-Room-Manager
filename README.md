This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Java. You will deal with multi-dimensional arrays and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.
The stats will show the current income, total income, the number of available seats, and the percentage of occupancy.
Now your menu should look like this:
1. Show the seats
2. Buy a ticket
3. Statistics
0. Exit
